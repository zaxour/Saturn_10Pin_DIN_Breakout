# Saturn_10Pin_DIN_Breakout
This is a simple breakout board for a 10 Pin DIN, such as that found on the Saturn. This was created to be used in conjunction with the TurboNanza Turbografx 16 modification so that composite, S-video and RGB could all be output through a single connector.

All of the files necessary are contained within the zip archive. Board was created in KiCad and the "jlcpcb" folder has everything necessary to have this manufactured and assembled via JLCPCB.
